# Notes for application development

## Routes

### Get Routes

TODO: Get recipe by recipe id. `/recipe/id=...`
The route should return all of the recipe data and its associated comments, user data, and category name

TODO: Get recipes `/recipes`
The route should return all of the recipes from the database, including its category information. We might want simply to return everything for every recipe because writing that query will be very similar to the one for an individual recipe. Again, we'll need to search across collecitons to generate this.

### Post Routes

TODO: Add recipe. It'll need to create a recipe and tie it to user and so on.
